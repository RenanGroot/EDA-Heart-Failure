# Exploratory Data Analysis - "Heart Failure"‚ù§ü©∫üìä

Repository dedicated to my "Heart Failure" Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA). On this repository there is a Jupyter Notebook, wich contains my EDA; and a .csv file, that holds the correspondenting dataset.

## Main Observations (spoiler alert)


 - Individuals from the ‚ÄúMale‚Äù Gender have showed a higher mortality level in comparision to their pairs.
 - Individuals who have Heart Failure Family‚Äôs History, showed a higher mortality level in comparision to their pairs.
    - The mortality proportion (non-survivor /survivor) of those who have heart failure family history: 8.0
    - The mortality proportion (non-survivor /survivor) of those who don't have heart failure family history: 3.1
 - Diabetic individuals has showed a higher mortality level in comparision to their pairs.
    - From all diabetics, just 9.6% have survived.
 - Individuals who have Smoking habits, have showed a higher mortality level in comparision to their pairs.
    - The mortality proportion (non-survivor /survivor) of those who smoke: 5.5
    - The mortality proportion (non-survivor /survivor) of those who don't smoke: 2.5
    - From all smokers, just 15.38% have survived.
 - The vast majority of individuals from this dataset have depression (~95%).
 - The individuals from this dataset have showed high levels of C.P.K. in the blood.
    - Which can be related as an indication of damage to CK-rich tissue (like myocardial tissue). Since all the individuals had a heart failure, this could explain the high levels, and even the outliers.
 - There are 169 people (~46%) that would be classified as hypertense on this dataset.
    - Hypertension Stage 1: 130-139mmHg
 - At least 17% from the individuals have reached, or exceeded, the 100% Heart Rate limit.
    - And 89% from these current individuals haven't survived.
 - The majority of the people in this dataset has hyperlipidemia (93%).
 - There weren‚Äôt great differences when looking to mortality levels around these variables: Depression, Hemoglobin, Cholesterol, C.P.K., Resting Blood Pressure, Max Heart Rate, Hyperlipidemia, Platelet Count.
 - When combining Diabetes and Smoking, two factors that have demonstrated some relationship with Mortality, the mortality level is even higher than one factor by itself.
